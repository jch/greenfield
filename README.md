## Referencing Image Assets

The [sprockets-sass](https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-sass)
and [sprockets-helpers](https://github.com/petebrowne/sprockets-helpers) gems
provide helper to reference your assets.

For example, to reference an image in your sass files:

```css
// put your images in assets/images
.sidebar
  background: url(asset-path('bg.png'))
```

If you prefer to put your assets in a different path, append another
lookup path in config.ru.
